# Basic-code-of-C++
Experiment-1



Aim  
* To write and execute a basic "Hello World" program in C++ using Visual Studio Code.  
* To create a Simple Calculator in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations using switch-case statements.

Apparatus  
* Computer (Laptop/Desktop)  
* Keyboard and Mouse  
* Power Supply  

Software Used  
* Visual Studio Code  
* MinGW or GCC/G++ Compiler  
* Terminal or Command Prompt

Theory  
* C++ is a structured and object-oriented programming language that offers high performance and reliability for software development.  
* It supports essential programming concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and strong type-checking.  
* The "Hello World" program is the simplest and most traditional way to test if the programming environment is working correctly.  
* It introduces core syntax elements such as headers, the main function, and output using `cout`.  
* The Simple Calculator program uses a switch-case statement to perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.  
* It also demonstrates taking input from the user using `cin` and using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.  
* This helps reinforce concepts like control flow, operator usage, and error handling (e.g., avoiding division by zero).  
* These beginner-level programs help establish a foundation in logic building and syntax understanding.  
* Writing and running these programs in Visual Studio Code gives practical experience in compiling and debugging.  
* They also introduce command-line compilation, basic I/O operations, and using conditional logic in C++.  
* Together, they build confidence in setting up a working C++ environment and understanding core coding principles.  
* These exercises prepare learners for more complex problem-solving using C++.

Programs Covered  
* Hello World Program  
* Displays the message "Hello, World!" on the console.  
* Helps understand the structure and output format of a basic C++ program.  

* Simple Calculator Program  
* Takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user.  
* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the selected operator.  
* Uses switch-case for logical control based on user input.

Conclusion  
* Both programs were successfully written, compiled, and executed using Visual Studio Code and the GCC compiler.  
* The Hello World program confirmed that the development environment was set up correctly.  
* The Calculator program strengthened understanding of user input, control structures, and arithmetic logic.  
* These programs together laid the foundation for more advanced C++ programming tasks and helped in building logical thinking.
