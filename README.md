# Basic-code-of-C-
Experiment-1


In this experiment, we have done two simple programs of c++

1.Hello World program
This is a basic C++ program that simply displays the message "Hello, World!" on the screen. It's typically the first program written when learning a new programming language, helping beginners understand how the structure of a C++ program works.

The program demonstrates:

Including standard header files

Defining the main() function

Using std::cout to display output

It serves as a foundational example to test your compiler setup and get familiar with basic syntax.

2.Simple calculator program
The Simple Calculator is a console-based C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

The user is prompted to enter two numbers and choose an operator. The program then calculates and displays the result.

This program covers:

Taking user input using std::cin

Using conditional statements (if / else if)

Performing arithmetic calculations

Handling division safely

It's a great beginner project to practice logic building, control structures, and I/O in C++.
